Together with the well-known O(n log n) upper bound for finding a closest pair, this settles an open problem of Lee and Preparata. We also extend this O(n log n) upper bound to the following problem: Given a collection of sets with a total of n points in the plane, find for each point a closest neighbor that does not belong to the same set.}

abstract = {We present a novel method for exactly solving (in fact, counting solutions to) general constraint satisfaction optimization with at most two variables per constraint (e.g. MAX-2-CSP and MIN-2-CSP), which gives the first exponential improvement over the trivial algorithm. More precisely, the runtime bound is a constant factor improvement in the base of the exponent: the algorithm can count the number of optima in MAX-2-SAT and MAX-CUT instances in O(m32ωn/3) time, where ω<2.376 is the matrix product exponent over a ring. When the constraints have arbitrary weights, there is a (1+ε)-approximation with roughly the same runtime, modulo polynomial factors. Our construction shows that improvement in the runtime exponent of either k-clique solution (even when k=3) or matrix multiplication over GF(2) would improve the runtime exponent for solving 2-CSP optimization. Our approach also yields connections between the complexity of some (polynomial time) high-dimensional search problems and some NP-hard problems. For example, if there are sufficiently faster algorithms for computing the diameter of n points in ℓ1, then there is an (2-ε)n algorithm for MAX-LIN. These results may be construed as either lower bounds on the high-dimensional problems, or hope that better algorithms exist for the corresponding hard problems.}

abstract = {The k-SAT problem is to determine if a given k-CNF has a satisfying assignment. It is a celebrated open question as to whether it requires exponential time to solve k-SAT for k⩾3. Here exponential time means 2δn for some δ>0. In this paper, assuming that, for k⩾3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k⩾3, define sk=inf{δ:there exists 2δn algorithm for solving k-SAT}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k⩾3, sk>0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s∞ be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk⩽(1−d/k)s∞ for some constant d>0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2εnk′-CNFs in fewer variables for some k′⩾k and arbitrarily small ε>0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2εn for arbitrarily small ε>0.}
