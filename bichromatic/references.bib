abstract = {We present an algorithm to compute a Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a given set S of n points in @@@@d in time ��(Τd(N, N) logd N), where Τd(n, m) is the time required to compute a bichromatic closest pair among n red and m blue points in @@@@d. If Τd(N, N) = Ω(N1+ε), for some fixed ε &gt; 0, then the running time improves to ��(Τd(N, N)). Furthermore, we describe a randomized algorithm to compute a bichromatic closest pair in expected time ��((nm log n log m)2/3 + m log2 n + n log2 m) in @@@@3, which yields an ��(N4/3 log4/3 N) expected time algorithm for computing a Euclidean minimum spanning tree of N points in @@@@3.},
